I miss seeing you and having a brother around all the time. You're gonna keep doing great things and I can't wait to see how far you'll get with golf, MUN, and everything else. I hope your hair is surviving the hell you put it through, and wishing you the best next three years in the whole wide world!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

What stands out about you to me is that even when itâ€™s hard and youâ€™re tired, you keep going. Itâ€™s good to push yourself but also make sure you get lots of rest when you can. Whatever you do and wherever you go, Iâ€™ll be cheering for you! (P.S. I have no pics of you so hereâ€™s a pixel Austyn instead ðŸ¥³)",

Keep working through golf, school, and life. Stay strong and never lose focus, even when you just want to give in to procrastination. Be better than yesterday. Be stronger than last year. I have complete faith in you. Keep me in your thoughts!",
